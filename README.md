# DeckOfCards

Hello, this is my first repo on Github. I have made this project on C++, where it simulates the real life shuffling of cards. Also, we can sort the cards in different ways. And, the game of **BLACKJACK** is added. No compromises are made on the features of the game, that is, you will get the feel of the real game.(But obviously, can't you give the nice look on the terminal.)  The commands that you can give during the execution of the program are(commands are case sensitive):-

**Display** - *Displays the current order of cards.Cards are arranged in rows and the order is left to right.Note, your terminal font must be small enough to show the desired output.*

**Riffle Shuffle N** - *Does riffle-shuffle N number of times(for instance, Riffle Shuffle 4 - So riffle shuffle will be done 4 times). The logic behind this is that the deck of cards is divided into two equal stacks and alternately one card from each stack is displayed.*

**O Shuffle N** - *Does overhand-shuffle N number of times. Each time a random number of cards is taken from the middle and then it is put at the top of the remaining stack.*

**Shuffle N** - *Shuffles the cards N number of times. Each time a random number of cards is taken from the bottom and this stack is put in middle of the leftout stack at any random position.*

**Colour sort** - *Sorts the cards according to alphabetic order of the colours, that is, Black cards come first, then Red cards.*

**Suit sort** - *Sorts the cards according to alphabetic order of the suits, that is, Clubs, then Diamonds, then Hearts and at last Spades.*

**Value sort** - *Sorts the cards in ascending order of their values.*

**Sort** - *Sorts the cards completely where black cards comes first, then red cards. In black cards, Clubs come first, then Spades. In red cards, Diamonds come first, then Hearts. And for each suit, values are sorted in ascending order.*

**Blackjack** - *Starts the game of Blackjack.*

**End** - *Ends the program.*
